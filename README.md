# Rick and Morty

## App should:

- Enable viewing characters, locations and episodes (entities) from [RMApi](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
- Store and change which entities are marked as favorite
  in [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/rick-and-morty-d589c)
- Allow adding notes to entities
- Searching entities in query
- Detail of entity

## Would be good:

- Chronological view of episodes (with locations and characters showed)
- Authentication
- Creating own entities
